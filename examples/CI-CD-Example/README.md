# üéØ Overview

 This CI/CD example uses Jenkins to test the "Limitation of Power Consumption" on external EVSE.

### Jenkins
  - An open-source, Java-based, automation server that enables continuous integration/continuous delivery and deployment (CI/CD).
   
### Limitation of Power Consumption on External EVSE
- This example demonstrates how to automatically test the LPC failsafe scenario communication between a Controllable system (external EVSE) against an Energy Guard (EEBus-Hub CEM)..
