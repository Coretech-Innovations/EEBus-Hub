Documentation     Example 2 - EV and EVSE charging session.
...
...    A multi-entity scenario closer to a real EEBUS setup: create an EVSE and an
...    EV, connect the EV to the EVSE, and inspect the resulting state. It shows
...    patterns the first example does not:
...
...    - creating two different entity types and correlating their ids,
...    - a keyword with TWO path parameters (``Connect EV To EVSE`` takes evId + evseId),
...    - waiting on an asynchronous action with ``Wait Until Keyword Succeeds``,
...    - updating an entity with ``Modify EV`` and reading a sub-resource back,
...    - handling an expected failure (a bad id comes back as ``ok=False``, not a raise).
...
...    Prerequisites: a Hub running with ``--robotremote`` and a license that has
...    ``robotFrameworkSupported: true``. See README.md in this folder.

*** Test Cases ***
Connect The EV To The EVSE
    [Documentation]    ``Connect EV To EVSE`` takes two path parameters, evId and
    ...    evseId. Every generated keyword takes its arguments by name -- argument
    ...    order follows the OpenAPI spec and is not stable across releases, so
    ...    positional binding is refused. Pairing between the two simulated devices
    ...    is asynchronous, so poll until it settles.
    ${r}=    Connect EV To EVSE    evId=${EV_ID}    evseId=${EVSE_ID}
    Should Be Successful    ${r}
    Wait Until Keyword Succeeds    15x    2s    EV Reports A Connected EVSE

Update The EV And Read It Back
    [Documentation]    ``Modify EV`` accepts a partial body; only the named fields
    ...    are sent. Then confirm the change is reflected when reading the entity.
    ${updated}=    Modify EV    evId=${EV_ID}    charged=${42}    chargingEnable=${False}
    Should Be Successful    ${updated}

    ${view}=    Get EV    evId=${EV_ID}
    Should Be Successful    ${view}

Asking For A Nonexistent EV Fails Gracefully
    [Documentation]    A 4xx does not raise on its own; it returns with ``ok=False``.
    ...    That is how you assert on expected error paths.
    ${r}=    Get EV    evId=999999
    Should Be Equal As Integers    ${r}[status_code]    404
    Should Not Be True    ${r}[ok]


*** Keywords ***
Set Up Fresh EV And EVSE
    [Documentation]    Reset the simulation, then create one EVSE and one EV and
    ...    remember their ids for the whole suite.
    Reset Simulation To A Clean State

    ${evse}=    Add EVSE    evseccEnabled=${True}
    Should Be Successful    ${evse}
    Set Suite Variable    ${EVSE_ID}    ${evse}[json][id]

    ${ev}=    Add EV
    Should Be Successful    ${ev}
    Set Suite Variable    ${EV_ID}    ${ev}[json][id]

EV Reports A Connected EVSE
    [Documentation]    Poll helper: succeeds once the EV listing shows this EV paired
    ...    to our EVSE. ``List EVs`` returns an array; each entry carries
    ...    ``connectedToEVSE`` and (once paired) an ``evseId``.
    ${listing}=    List EVs
    Should Be Successful    ${listing}
    ${matches}=    Evaluate
    ...    [e for e in $listing['json'] if e['evId'] == ${EV_ID}]
    Should Not Be Empty    ${matches}    EV ${EV_ID} not found in the listing
    ${ev}=    Set Variable    ${matches}[0]
    Should Be True    ${ev}[connectedToEVSE]    EV ${EV_ID} is not connected yet
    Should Be Equal As Integers    ${ev}[evseId]    ${EVSE_ID}
