# LPC User Stories

This folder contains different examples to see the Limitation of Power Consumption use case (LPC) in action

## Actors 

- Controllable system
- Energy Guard

## Supported Scenarios

All four scenarios represented in the EEBus documentation are supported:
- Control active power consumption limit
- Failsafe Values
- Heartbeat
- Constraints

## Examples List

| Example | Description|
| :---- | :------ |
| LPC1 | Applying Active power consumption limit on simulated EVSE|
| LPC2 | Applying Failsafe consumption active power simulated EVSE|
| LPC3 | Applying Active power consumption limit and failsafe consumption power limit on external EVSE|
| LPC4 | Applying Active power consumption limit on simulated EVSE associated with EV and monitor the EV Current|
