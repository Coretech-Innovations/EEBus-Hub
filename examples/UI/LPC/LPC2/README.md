## Description

User Story: We are integrating an Energy Guard with an EVSE and establishing their connection. Post-connection, we will monitor the failsafe initial values in the EVSE.

Steps:

- Send Failsafe values: Specify the value and duration.

- Update EVSE State: Ensure the EVSE reflects its new Failsafe values.
