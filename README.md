# EEBus-Hub
EEBUS Hub is a testing and simulation framework for validating device integration over an EEBUS network. It builds on the [eebus-go](https://github.com/enbility/eebus-go) library for core EEBUS interactions and adds practical tooling to streamline real-world testing.

EEBUS Hub exposes APIs to control and orchestrate multiple EEBUS actors that participate in typical energy scenarios such as EV, EVSE, HEMS, Controlbox, Heatpump, Inverters and SMGW. You can run full simulations using built-in virtual devices, or plug in real hardware alongside simulated participants to accelerate integration, troubleshooting, and regression testing.

This repository includes examples that show how to use EEBUS Hub programmatically to automate your EEBUS testing procedures—ideal for CI pipelines and repeatable test suites.

Compliance support: EEBUS Hub helps manufacturers validate S14a compliance (and beyond) by enabling controlled, reproducible test scenarios and automated verification workflows.

## How to Use

These are simple API calls for adding an EVSE and an EV and connecting them with the HEMS
in the system. The HEMS is a built-in device that already exists when the Hub starts.

Entities can only be added while the simulation is stopped, and pairing is only allowed
while it is running, so the order below matters.

```bash
# Get the SKI of the HEMS
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/hems

# adding new EVSE (the failsafe and nominal power/current values are required)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/evse/add -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"deviceName":"Coretech EVSE WLBX", "deviceCode":"0002","deviceModel":"Charging Station","brandName":"Coretech Innovations","vendor":{"name":"Coretech Innovations","code":"60745"},"serialNumber":"SN7640","failsafeValue":0,"failsafeDuration":2,"failSafeDurationMax":24,"nominalPower":{"min":1380,"max":22080},"nominalCurrent":{"min":6,"max":32}}'

# adding new EV
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/ev/add -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"device": {"name": "Taycan", "code": "0003", "serialNumber": "SN1235"},"currentLimits": {"min": 5, "max": 10}, "asymmetricCharging": false}'

# starting the simulation
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/sim -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"action": "start", "speedFactor": 100}'

# Pairing the EVSE with the HEMS; the response carries the EVSE's own SKI
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/evse/<EVSE ID>/trust -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"remoteSKI": "<HEMS Ski>"}'

# Trusting the created EVSE from the HEMS side
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/hems/trust -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"remoteSKI": "<EVSE Ski>"}'

# adding the created EV to the EVSE we created before
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/ev/<EV ID>/evse/<EVSE ID>
```

HEMS Ski: The Ski returned from calling the GET request on the HEMS  
EVSE ID: The id returned from creating the EVSE  
EVSE Ski: The Ski returned from pairing the EVSE with the HEMS  
EV ID: The id returned from creating the EV
